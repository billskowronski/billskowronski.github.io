# Bill Skowronski — Simple Portfolio

This is a lightweight, single-page portfolio you can deploy in minutes.

## How to Use
1. **Edit content**: Open `index.html` and update the email/LinkedIn links in the Contact section. You can edit text anywhere in the file.
2. **Add more case studies**: Duplicate a card in the "Selected Work" section and add a new section below with the same pattern as Rome/Optimas.
3. **Deploy** (pick one):
   - **GitHub Pages**: Create a repo, upload these files, and enable Pages in repo settings (deploy from the `main` branch root).
   - **Netlify**: Drag & drop this folder on app.netlify.com → Sites → Deploy site.
   - **Vercel**: Import the repo and deploy as a static site.
   - **Local**: Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes
- Colors and spacing live in `styles.css`. Tweak the `:root` variables to re-theme.
- This site is intentionally no-build and no-framework for simple hosting.
